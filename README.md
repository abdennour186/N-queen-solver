# N-Queens Solver

## Description
This project provides a solver for the N-Queens problem using three different algorithms:
- **Genetic Algorithm**
- **Particle Swarm Optimization**
- **Backtracking Algorithm**

A graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Swing to visualize the solutions and interact with the solver.

## Features
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Optimizes the N-Queens placement using evolutionary techniques.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization**: Uses swarm intelligence to find optimal solutions.
- **Backtracking**: A classic approach to solving the N-Queens problem.
- **Swing Interface**: Provides a visual representation of the board and solutions.
